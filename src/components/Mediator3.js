                I qualified as a Family Mediator with the Family Mediatorsâ€™
                Association in 2017 and feel passionate about helping people
                solve their family disputes at one of the most emotionally
                difficult time of their lives. Like Kate, I had a career in
                media for over 30 years before deciding to train as a family
                mediator.

                I&#39;ve been responsible for running a team and recruiting
                people, nurturing them through a pressurised career path and
                being their support and mentor. I feel these skills make me a
                highly empathetic and successful mediator, where I can draw on
                my experience to help families reach amicable and long-lasting
                solutions.
