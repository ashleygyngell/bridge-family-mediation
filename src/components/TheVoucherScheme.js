              The Mediation Voucher Scheme is a one-off financial contribution
              of up to Â£500, introduced by the government in March 2021 to help
              people with their mediation costs.
            </p>
            <p>The Voucher Scheme isn&apos;t means tested.</p>
            <p>
              At the MIAM, the mediator will discuss whether your case is
              eligible for the Voucher Scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not all cases are eligible under the scheme. The case has to
              involve issues related to children, ie:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="ml-4">a dispute/application regarding a child.</li>
              <li className="ml-4">
                a dispute/application regarding family financial matters where
                the parties are also involved in a dispute/application relating
                to a child.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The money <strong>will not</strong> cover the cost of a MIAM, only
              the following joint mediation session/s.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mediator will forward you a consent form and you will be asked
              to confirm that you have:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="ml-4">
                asked the mediator to apply for the voucher.
              </li>
              <li className="ml-4">
                not already applied for another voucher as part of the same
                scheme.
              </li>
              <li className="ml-4">
                given consent to your mediator to provide your information to
                the Family Mediation Council, including your name and some basic
                information about your case.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The voucher is intended to be a contribution towards mediation,
              not necessarily to cover the whole cost.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              At Bridge Family Mediation, the voucher will cover 1-2 joint
              meetings. You may need to contribute additional funds, in order to
              complete the process.
