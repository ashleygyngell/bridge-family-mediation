                I trained as a Family Mediator with the Family Mediatorsâ€™
                Association in 2013 and hold full Family Mediation Council
                accreditation. I am also a qualified Professional Practice
                Consultant, supervising other family mediators in their
                professional development.

                I have wide experience and knowledge of family law, having
                worked for 20 years as a family solicitor. I now work full time
                in mediation, covering all issues, and have particular
                experience of dealing with complex cases involving sensitive
                issues. I am also qualified to see children within the mediation
                process. My approach is to listen, guide and explore options in
                a calm and balanced environment.
