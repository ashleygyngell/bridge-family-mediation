              <strong>What personal data is involved? </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mediation clients (and prospective mediation clients) provide
              us directly with almost all of the data we process. The only
              exceptions are a) when data is provided by solicitors or some
              other professionals (at the clients&apos; request or with their
              consent) or b) when someone who is interested in resolving an
              issue by mediating provides us with an email address or other
              contact information so that we can offer the other person a
              meeting to explore whether or not mediation might be a good way
              forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How is the personal data gathered? </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We collect and process data when you contact us using an email
              address or by telephone (unless you block the actual number you
              are calling on), or when you use our website contact form. We
              collect and process data while exploring with you whether or not
              mediation is a real option for your family.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also collect and process personal data during the mediation
              process itself &mdash; including but not limited to personal
              financial and health data. The data collected sometimes includes
              personal data about children over 13 but we consider that it is
              not proportionate to contact every child over 13 with a separate
              privacy notice about the limited information we hold about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also collect and process personal data during child-inclusive
              mediation sessions (during which we meet directly with young
              people). Our invitations to a child over the age of 13 do include
              an age appropriate privacy notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What control do you still have over your data?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Your information can only be shared outside the mediation process
              with your knowledge and prior consent (unless we are required to
              share it with someone in order to meet our professional
              obligations as mediators registered with the Family Mediation
              Council &mdash; this exception is explained in more detail below).
            </p>
            <p>
              We will handle your personal data only in ways you would
              reasonably expect and we will not do anything unlawful with the
              data.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are entitled to access the personal data we hold about you,
              within one month of our receipt of your request. We will provide a
              copy of the information free of charge, although we are entitled
              to ask for a reasonable fee or payment to cover the cost of
              producing such information when a request is manifestly unfounded
              or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive. We may also charge
              a reasonable fee to comply with requests for further copies of the
              same information. In all cases any fee charged will be based on
              the administrative cost of providing the information.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if data contains information about another person, such
              information cannot be provided without that other person&apos;s
              permission.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>You are entitled to have inaccurate personal data rectified.</p>
            <p>
              You are entitled to have the information deleted (“erased”). The
              right to have information deleted applies if the personal data is
              no longer necessary for its original purpose &mdash; if you want
              us to delete your data, that is very likely to mean that mediation
              isn&apos;t suitable or is no longer possible.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              You also have a limited right to &apos;restriction&apos; of your
              data within one month of our receipt of your request, which might
              for example, permit the data to be held on file for complaints or
              other purposes, but not used in any other way, for example, by
              sending you an email. You can also ask us to give you a copy of
              your data in a format that allows you to use it elsewhere &mdash;
              data portability &mdash; again within one month of our receipt of
              your request.

                What do we do with your data and why is it legal for us to use
                it?{' '}

            </p>
            <p>
              As family mediators, we are &apos;processors&apos; of personal
              data for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation.
              Processing (or using) personal data always has to be for a
              legitimate purpose - our purposes all relate to mediation, either
              providing our mediation services to people who have signed our
              Agreement to Mediate, or giving families the opportunity to find
              out more about family mediation as a way of resolving a family
              issue. In order to provide these mediation services as accredited
              family mediators, we also have to comply with the professional
              obligations imposed on us by the Family Mediation Council. These
              include obligations to make your personal data available to other
              people in certain limited circumstances. Our practice supervisors,
              a complaints handler or the Legal Aid Agency may have sight of our
              files (as explained below) but access is strictly controlled and
              on a confidential basis.{' '}

                <i>If you decide to mediate with us</i>

              , we ask you to consent to us processing your personal data by
              signing our Agreement to Mediate. If you sign our Agreement, you
              consent to us processing your personal data as part of your
              contract with us &mdash; our legal basis for processing your data
              if you are mediating with us is contract. This includes us
              retaining and storing your personal data for as long as is
              necessary in connection with the Agreement, to include a period of
              2 years after the mediation concludes, in case of complaint. It
              also includes giving us permission to share your personal data
              with our practice supervisors and/or any person appointed by the
              Family Mediation Council to consider a complaint about the
              mediation We may retain data for research and statistical
              purposes, but only on the understanding that if used for this
              purpose all identifying details will have been removed. We will
              not process your data for any other purpose.

                  Before this, while you and we are working out whether or not
                  mediation is a good option for your family
                </i>
              </u>
              , we will usually process a very limited amount of your personal
              data, for example your contact details, so that we can communicate
              with you and assess your suitability for family mediation.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              <i> If you have contacted us</i>, we are able to process your
              personal data for the limited purpose of exploring with you
              whether or not mediation is a good way forward for your family.
              Because you have contacted us, asking us to do this, our legal
              basis for processing the very limited personal data that you give
              us is still contract (even though you have not yet signed the
              Agreement).{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>If you have not contacted us</i>, we are only able to process
              your contact details (usually an email address or phone number) in
              order to offer you the opportunity to explore family mediation as
              an option. In this case our legal basis for processing your
              personal data is the public task of giving families access to
              mediation as an alternative to litigation. The Children and
              Families Act 2014, s 10, introduced a mediation information and
              assessment process and requires the majority of people to show
              that they have attended a mediation information and assessment
              meeting, and have considered family mediation as an option, before
              they ask the court to make a decision about their family.
              Contacting someone to give them access to this mediation
              information and assessment process is therefore a way to protect
              their legal rights within the family justice system.
