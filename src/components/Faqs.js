        Family Mediation is highly successful in resolving disputes about money,
        property and arrangements for children. Mediation works at your pace,
        keeps costs to a minimum and helps you bring about fair and lasting
        agreements. It is tempting to think that going to court is the best
        place to sort out divorce matters and &#39; win the battle&#39; against
        your ex. However, the financial and emotional cost of legal proceedings
        can be significant and the process can take many months, even years, to
        settle. So before you go down that route, please give Family Mediation a
        go. Mediation works alongside the Family Law system. We are all up to
        date on latest legal developments and recent cases. We understand the
        steps you need to take to finalise your divorce and make provision for
        your future, and the lives of your children. Mediators do not take sides
        and we are trained to make sure your discussions are calm, balanced and
        fair. We offer a safe space, where you can talk freely and
        confidentially to settle your differences. We don&#39;t tell you what to
        do but we can guide you through a range of options, to help you make
        your own decisions. We know only too well that each case is unique and
        that all our clients have their own set of circumstances. Our role is to
        work with you to find the best possible outcome for your situation and
        help you draw up a set of agreed proposals, which can then be turned
        quickly and easily into a legally-binding document. It is now widely
        accepted that when couples reach a resolution in mediation, the
        long-term emotional health and happiness of their children are notably
        better than when they fight out their issues in court. To help bring
        about arrangements that have the children&#39;s best interests at heart,
        we can talk to children separately as part of the mediation process, if
        both parents feel it would be useful to hear what they really think and
        as long as the children want to talk to us. And finally, mediation does
        work! Even the most intractable arguments can be resolved with the right
        encouragement and 85% of couples who attend mediation with an open mind
        reach agreement without going to court.
